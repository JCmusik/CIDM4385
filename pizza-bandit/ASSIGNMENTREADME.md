# Assignment 1 - Converting Bootstrap to Components

#### Assignment 1

From assignment 0 you should have attempted the design, mockup and prototyping of a user interface for a "Price Line" style pizza app.

Later on, I told you to model your work based on this: https://reactjs.org/docs/thinking-in-react.html

So, our journey here is quite simple: translate your HTML/Bootstrap work into ReactJS components.

#### Guidance for this may come from at least these three sources:

- The Book: Chapters 1-3 in particular
- The Documentation: Start here (https://reactjs.org/docs/hello-world.html) and go through section 12
- My videos - I just posted two on this topic (look in Lessons/Videos)

#### What to Submit

- Copy and paste the URL to your Github repo here
- ZIP up the directory containing your work and submit it here (follow the example from my videos)
